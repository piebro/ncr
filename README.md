# Explaining

With <https://piebro.github.io/ncr/encrypt.html> you can encrypt a text with OpenPGP.js.

I use it to show a password protected website by evaluating a encrypted javascript function. Each .html file has everything it needs written in it.

An example is here: <https://piebro.github.io/ncr> the password is 'secret'. You can check out what the source of the decrypted website looks like in the console log.

to make your own secret html page:

1. copy the templetplain.html file and design your page with the javascript function

2. when you finished your design copy the function

3. open the index.html check "edit" on and enter "secret" as the password and past your function in the textarea

4. save the page with a new password and you have your own secret site
