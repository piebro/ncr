# Explaining

With <https://piebro.github.io/ncr/encrypt.html> you can encrypt a text with OpenPGP.js.

I use it to show a password protected website. Each .html file has everything it needs written in it.

An example is here: <https://piebro.github.io/ncr> the password is 'secret'. You can check out what the source of the decrypted website looks like in the console log.
